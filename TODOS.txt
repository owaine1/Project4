30 Nov evening
db/mongoose_connect.js DONE but might need refinement

// TODO likely strip whole code down to 1 single page of ejs, without login, with the 60 limited requests.
// re-read agin the githubapi documentation https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/basics-of-authentication/
// Action plan idea
Possibly look at https://developer.github.com/v3/libraries/ in particular Javascript(5) though other c based (e.g. Java (3), PHP(8), Python(8)) And likely build all 5 so that they are working, play with the others.
And just continue to build simple github APIs. Feeling as if I don't understand the basic concepts well enough
//Pos look at passport (some 1/2 hourâ€“1 hour long youtube videos)
// The Net Ninja, on youtube, has 21 videos on passportjs. Maybe worthwhile going through all of them


// TODO / IDEAS later functionality of the drag and drop to be saved / created on mongodb and this to be recalled from mongodb
// schema would be with nested objects
// declaring inner objects first
// need one for on main github page // will take some time
// Repositories
// Conributions
// Followers
// Following
//
// one for settings page // will take a LOT of time
// settings has 2 areas: selected 6 possible windows that you can rearrange and deselect and 5 deselected slots that you can drag and drop the windows to and from.
// here would need 2 schemas
// so likely need: 3 inner schemas that go into 1 main schema.
something like, but not right (maybe the code for drag and drop itself might have answers)
//pseudo code
// var home_page_order = {
  repositories: a, b, c or d,
  contributions: a, b, c or d,
  followers: a, b, c or d,
  following: a, b, c or d,
}
var settings_page_selected = {
profile: a, b, c, d, e, f,
account: a, b, c, d, e, f,
notifications: a, b, c, d, e, f,
ssh_and_gpg_keys: a, b, c, d, e, f,
security: a, b, c, d, e, f,
blocked_users: a, b, c, d, e, f,
}
var settings_page_deselected = {
profile: a, b, c, d, e, f,
account: a, b, c, d, e, f,
notifications: a, b, c, d, e, f,
ssh_and_gpg_keys: a, b, c, d, e, f,
security: a, b, c, d, e, f,
blocked_users: a, b, c, d, e, f,
}
// there are bugs in this already. e.g. wondering if should just be booleans

then 
home_page_order
settings_page_selected
settings_page_deselected
all within GITUSER in mongoose_connection.js

You want on page load a get request in mainroutes.js of user preferences on login?
